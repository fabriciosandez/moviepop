# MoviePop

This project was created using React.JS and Material UI. The different routes were established based on React Router v6.6.2 while the data was obtained from The Movie Database API. Alice Carousel and Axios are also required to run the project.

The website was designed considering a Full HD Desktop resolution of 1920x1080 and the responsive design was created for IPhone 12 resolution. However, it is also posible to view the site correctly on other resolutions.
